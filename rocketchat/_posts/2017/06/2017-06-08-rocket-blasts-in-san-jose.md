Hi everyone,
here is a very quick follow-up on our "A round of drinks with Rocket.Chat" meet-up in San Jose Â yesterday evening which was a resounding success!

Approximately 30 people turned up and we can happily report that we made quite a few new friends, had a chance to meet some long-time supporters, introduced a few of you to Rocket.Chat, and, more importantly, we all had a blast (sorry, bad pun... ;) ) amidst all the conference activities.

A special thank you to our venue, the [Continental Bar, Lounge, & Patio](http://thecontinentalbar.com/)! The atmosphere of the space proved perfect for this type of gathering - All in all, it was an amazing night and we thank everyone who took part in it.
