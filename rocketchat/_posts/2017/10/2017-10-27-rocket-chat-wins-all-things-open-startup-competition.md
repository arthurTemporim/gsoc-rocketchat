This week Rocket.Chat was at [All Things Open (ATO)](https://allthingsopen.org/) in Raleigh, North Carolina to show our support for open source and to compete in the second [ATO "Open" pitch Competition](https://allthingsopen.org/start-up-pitch-competition/). All Things Open is the largest open source, open tech, and open web conference on the east coast of the United States. Gabriel put on his best spacesuit and gave an out-of-this-world pitch to win the ATO 2017 Startup Competition.

## The ultimate open communication platform

As a community, we are unified around creating the ultimate open communication platform, where you have complete control of your data and platform - no restrictions, no limits. The result, Rocket.Chat, is the most open and customizable team chat platform on the market, with no compromises on features. Our core platform was built for enterprises and will always be free.

## Blockchain embraces open communication

In the past few months Rocket.Chat has seen a surge of adoption from blockchain and cryptocurrency communities who made the move from closed solutions such as Slack- where it was not possible to customize workflows- to provide a more secure environment for their users or add their own integrated features to their server and client apps.
