Rocket.Chat might have plenty of out-of-the-box features, but you can make it even more useful, efficient and fun with integrations.

Integrations (based on webhooks) connect the tools you already use with Rocket.Chat for a simplified workflow and improved team communication.

This post covers ten of the best integrations created by the Rocket.Chat team and community.

## GitHub

GitHub makes it easy to store Git projects, track changes and stay organized when working on individual or team projects.

It's been used for projects as diverse as creating a repository for <a href="http://gregorio-project.github.io" target="_blank">Gregorian Chants</a> to storing the <a href="https://github.com/benbalter/congressional-districts" target="_blank">history of U.S. congressional districts</a> to a popular open source team chat solution.

With the GitHub integration for Rocket.Chat you can receive alerts, commit events and make pull requests.

## Trello

Another popular collaboration tool, Trello is a virtual whiteboard where teams and individuals can add notes, photos and attachments from other sources to collate what they're working on in one place.

With the Trello integration you can simplify your workflow with notifications on who has joined, contributed to or completed a project without needing to leave Rocket.Chat.

## Guggy

Although the integration for Guggy might not make you and your team more productive, it'll certainly make work a lot more _fun_.

Guggy is slash-style command for Rocket.Chat that sends your regular text message to Guggy, which then transforms it into a GIF.

## Jira

The software development app favored by many product teams, Jira makes it easy to plan, track and ship software.

Linking Jira saves a team the manual work of copying and pasting status updates into Rocket.Chat.

By writing a messaged like 'let's check out SUP-1234+' you'll receive a summary of any issues mentioned in Jira without needing to leave Rocket.Chat.

## Google Calendar

Google Calendar helps teams to stay organized with shared calendars and event reminders.

The integration for Rocket.Chat posts details about any events scheduled for that day and updates team members when an event is changed.

## BitRocket

Another contribution from our passionate community, BitRocket integrates Atlassian BitBucket Server or Cloud with Rocket.Chat to send notifications for code pushes and pull requests or comments on pull requests to any branch.

## Sentry

Sentry is an open source error tracking tool that helps developers track crashes in real time.

This integration works both for Sentry's site and the self-hosted version.

## Moodle

Widely used by colleges and universities around the world, Moodle is a free and open source virtual learning environment.

The Moodle integration enables users to push students from Moodle into channels on Rocket.Chat. These channels correspond to their groups on Moodle.

## Dead Simple Screen Sharing

Share your screen for free with no install or signup. There's also an open source version <a href="https://github.com/mlakkadshaw/DeadSimpleScreeSharing" target="_blank">available on GitHub</a>.

Create a meeting right from Rocekt.Chat by typing "screenshare" or any other trigger word of your choice.

## rocket-chat-lunch-club

Spend less time arguing over where to order team lunches with rocket-chat-team-lunch, a community-built integration that picks a restaurant at random when you send a food emoji.

To make the integration even more efficient, you can add PDF food menus to the attachments field to view the restaurant's offerings without leaving Rocket.Chat
