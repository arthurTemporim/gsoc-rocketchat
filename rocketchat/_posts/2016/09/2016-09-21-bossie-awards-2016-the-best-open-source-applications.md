Rocket.Chat is pleased to announce that it has been selected as one the best open source applications by InfoWorld's Bossie awards.

Infoworld's Bossies (Best of Open Source Software) awards have been recognizing the most innovative open source software for businesses and professional users since 2010.

Some are projects that have reinvented themselves and endured - such as LibreOffice - and others are completely new.

Rocket.Chat was one of twelve recipients of the prestigious award, which also included iDempiere, Alfresco and Talend Open Studio.

Rocket.Chat was selected thanks to its wide range of features - including screen sharing, voice messaging and video conferencing - deployment options, easy Slack import and its large and active open source community.
