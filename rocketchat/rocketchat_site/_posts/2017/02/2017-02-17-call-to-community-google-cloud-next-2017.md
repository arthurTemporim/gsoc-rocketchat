Rocket.Chat has been invited to present at [Google Cloud Next 2017](https://cloudnext.withgoogle.com/), which takes place March 8th-10th.

Google Cloud Next is one of the most important events of its kind, and this year the speaker line-up includes Eric Schmidt, Executive Chairman of Alphabet and Google CEO, Sundar Pichai.

Thousands of cloud professionals, executives, developers, IT decision makers and venture capitalists are expected to attend the event.

Rocket.Chat will be one of the startups hand-picked by Google to exhibit at the Next 2017's "Startup Village" venue.

We always love to meet members of the community, so, if you're attending Next 2017, make sure to drop by the Rocket.Chat table and say hello!

## Special GitHub Project Milestone and remote hackathon

In celebration of the event, Rocket.Chat has also created a special repository milestone, _[Google Cloud Next 2017](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/milestone/64)_. The whole community is encouraged to participate towards the repo by submitting a pull request or leaving a comment. All contributors will be rewarded with a Rocket.Chat perk of their choice!

From March 3-5th we will also be airing segments of our remote Hackathon, where key Rocket.Chat developers and founder Gabriel Engel will be taking part.

You can join the hackathon through [#nexthackathon17](https://open.rocket.chat/channel/nexthackathon17) on our community server.

## Post-event meetup

If you're in the Bay area, come join us at the first-ever [Rocket.Chat-hosted meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Rocket-Chat-San-Francisco-Bay-Area/events/237858761/)  on March 10th at 7pm (location TBC).

Gabriel Engel and Rodrigo will be talking about Rocket.Chat's architecture and scaling techniques while Aaron and Sing will be on-hand with advice on bots and new deployment options, like Snaps.

Beers, soft drinks and snacks will all be available alongside limited-edition Rocket.Chat collectables!
