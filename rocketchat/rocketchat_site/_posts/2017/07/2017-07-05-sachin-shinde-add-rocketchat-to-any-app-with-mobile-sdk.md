_This series of blogs brings you a little closer to our active student contributors for the [Google Summer of Code 2017](https://rocket.chat/docs/contributing/google-summer-of-code) summer season. You will see their ongoing work featured throughout our [GitHub repositories](https://github.com/RocketChat) . Feel free to drop by and say "hello", or start collaborating on any of the projects._

Our Google Summer of Code student Sachin Shinde aims to use his passion for coding to change the world! The first step will be Sachin's participation in the Google Summer of Code 2017 Rocket.Chat Android SDK project. 

Sachin is studying for a degree in Information Technology at the [Pune Institute of Computer Technology](http://pict.edu/) , India. He will be graduating this year. He enjoys the Institute's culture, and believes it this as well as the wide range of technical and cultural events that stimulate innovation. 

Sachin knows this is an important moment in his career and he is determined to make the most of the Rocket.Chat team's expertise. During the summer, he will be working on the Android SDK project with our team. He has already worked with most of the technologies required for the project, so it was a natural fit.  

He explains: "This project is about developing chat client and LiveChat client which can be embedded into any Android app. It can be used by large community of developers as communication with users and among themselves is required in most of the applications. I'm currently using Android Studio as an IDE. My objective is not just to create a project, but to create a _MASTERPIECE_."

We are looking forward to watching the masterpiece develop - it sounds like Sachin has some exciting plans!

If you want to follow Sachin's progress over the summer, we will be sharing updates on the Rocket.Chat blog, Facebook and Twitter. Or, check out the always up-to-date Google Summer of Code documents section on the Rocket.Chat website.
